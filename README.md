# Rust Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Work in Progress)

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Rust. The project takes inspiration from the project suggestions offered by App Academy Open's Software Engineering Foundations curriculum (legacy version). It is a personal project intended for learning Rust programming. It is so far quite the journey, and I am thoroughly enjoying it.

"One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."

Please Note: This project is a work in progress and is not yet complete, i.e. the game is not yet playable.
